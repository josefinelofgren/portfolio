      Beyond evaluating the capabilites of the app, the goal of my competivtive analysis was to find common themes of users experiences and learn how the product meets and fails to meet users goals and needs. I made a list of features I found most important and compared them. By doing this I saw a change of beating the competitors in those points.`,

    initialDesignIdeasPoint1:
      "Login is available with Google, Facebook and email. At first I wasn't sure if this function was necessary but as the idea of the app evolved. I quickly realised that it was needed if the user should be able to book through the app and store things such as favorites etc.",
    initialDesignIdeasPoint2:
      "The explore page is where the user is directed to after logging in/signing up. The explore page contains a map where the user are able to see all dog friendly locations.

    initialDesignIdeasPoint3:
      "The favorite page is a place where the user can save places they would like to visit in the future. There's no limit of how many places a user can save as a favorite which made it hard to find a specific saved place in the list of favorites, therefor I added a filter function to make it easier to sort them by categories.",

After several different brainstorming sessions and iterations, I started buildning a high-fiedlity prototype. To ensure a consistent design system, I played around with fonts and colors and create the following visual language guide.",
    usabilityTestingDescription: `I asked the same participants as I used for my user interviews (5 participants) to test the prototype I had made for the app and asked them to explain their thoughts and feeling outload while going through the different stages. I wanted to see how they would interact with the features.
      
      I made two different designs of the informative page of the chosen location and made the users try out both of them. The second design got much better feedback so I decided to go with it. The users gave me some valuable insights so I added some smaller details such as the address and a description for the email, website and share icons.`,

    learningsDescription:
      "When designing an app from scratch, it's easy to get overexcited and ambitious and aim at creating a complete product, which is most likely not possible since I worked on this project on my own and the timeline was less then 2 months. At some points I was working on two or three different extra features within the app at thte same time, which made me lose a lot of focus on the main features.",
